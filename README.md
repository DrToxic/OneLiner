# OneLiner
I wrote this for when I'm streaming. takes a nice long list, and spews out ONE line at random to a pre-defined text file for OBS to read.

Load an input file, select an output file, configure the delay, click start.

A single random line will be written to the output file for OBS to read. It's really not that hard.
